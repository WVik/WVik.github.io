## 1. Goldman Sachs,Bangalore
Currently I work at Goldman Sachs, Bangalore in the Global Markets Division, where I work on the European equity trading desk. My work involves developing optimization tools for real-time equity pricing and trading framework. 

## 2. Leibniz Universit√§t, Hannover (July 2019 - July 2020)
I worked at the **L3S Research Centre, LUH** as a research assistant to complete my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Prof. Avishek Anand, Dr. Megha Khosla and Dr. Daniel Kudenko. My work involved developing representation learning algorithms for reinforcement learning tasks for discrete navigation tasks. We developed a novel technique for using representation learning algorithms to enhance the deep-Q network.

## 3. Goldman Sachs, Bengaluru (May 2019 - July 2018)
Last summer I worked with **Goldman Sachs** in the Securities division. I developed a complete web application for a trading platform. It was developed with **ReactJS**. Another project involved building a **predictive mathematical model** for market impact of large orders. It also involved developing visualization tools to show market trends. 

## 4. Microsoft - IDC, Hyderabad (May 2018 - July 2018)
I worked with **Microsoft India Development Center** in the summer of 2018. I was in the STCI team, specifically **Bing**. There are multiple teams in Bing, and I was a part of the Knowledge Graph team, called **Satori**. I worked with one of India's leading data scientist, **Joy Mustafi**.
My work was on **entity classification** problem. As one can imagine, Bing has a mammoth task of being able to answer queries of so many different kinds. For efficient answering of queries, every entity in the database has to be given a type.In fact, each entity is a part of an ontology. My task was to improve the precision and recall of the this classification. I used **Machine Learning** and **NLP** techniques along with **Neural Nets** to do so. I not only learnt these skills, but it made gave me insight on how these techniques are employed on such a large scale. It was a wonderful experience working with Microsoft for 8 weeks!

## 5. Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun:
**IIRS** is a Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) affiliated institute of remote sensing. I interned at IIRS in the summer of 2017 in the **Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Lab**. My mentors were scientists **Shefali Agarwal and Shashi Kumar**. My work was on calibration of satellites. Specifically, I worked on datasets from a category of satellites called **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** satellites. These satellites periodically send data to Earth. To make sure that the measurements made by the satellite are reliable, they are periodically calibrated. For calibration, they take images of reflectors on Earth whose reflectance properties are known. Then the experimental and theoretical values are compared and we get an idea of how reliable the satellite measurements are.

My task was to develop a tool to calculate the calibration parameters from those satellite images. I applied **image processing** techniques to do so. Along with that, a complete end to end pipeline was made with Python. The software and the code was made publicly available [here](https://github.com/WVik/sar-calibration-using-snappy).
