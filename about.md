title: About Me!

<br>
<br>

I am a fourth year undergrad at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/). I'm pursuing **B.E. Computer Science** and **MSc. Mathematics** here at BITS (2015-2020).

I've always been interested in and at the same time fascinated by mathematics and computer science. At BITS, I got this opportunity to take study both these subjects in the form a a dual degree. Now being in my fourth year, I can say that I've thoroughly enjoyed studying both these subjects. The domains that interest me the most are the ones that lie in the intersection of both these fields like **Machine Learning**, **AI**, **Computational Mathematics**, etc. Not to mention, I always like exploring new fields! Recently, I was introduced to the world of **High Performance Computing** at a research lab at my university. I'm enjoying working in the lab as an undergraduate researcher.

In my free time I usually code, read, do recreational math, watch movies, or play the guitar. You can find me on

I'm also interested in astronomy and like to read up on topics like space travel and exploration and cosmology. Also, HG2G is one of my favorite books! :P
