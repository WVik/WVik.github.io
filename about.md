title: About Me!
---



I am a fourth year undergrad at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/). I'm pursuing **B.E. Computer Science** and **MSc. Mathematics** here at BITS (2015-2020). Find more about me [here](/about.html)!

I've always been interested in and at the same time fascinated by mathematics and computer science. At BITS, I got this opportunity to take study both these subjects in the form a a dual degree. Now being in my fourth year, I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed studying both these subjects. The domains that interest me the most are the ones that lie in the intersection of math and computer science like **Machine Learning**, **AI** and **Computational Mathematics**. Not to mention, I always like exploring new and new areas!
