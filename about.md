title: About Me
---


<br><br>

I've always been interested in and at the same time fascinated by mathematics and computer science. Currently I work at Goldman Sachs, Bangalore in the Global Markets Division. At Goldman Sachs, I work in the European equity trading desk. Before that graduated at BITS with majors in Computer Science and Mathematics in the form of a dual degree. I've thoroughly enjoyed studying both these subjects. The domains that interest me the most are **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and **High Performance Computing**. Recently, the developments in interpretable and scalable Artificial Intelligence have caught my interest owing to the wide applicability of these topics in today's industry.

I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Masters in Mathematics from  [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/). 

In my free time I usually code, read, do recreational math, watch movies, or play the guitar. You can find me on
