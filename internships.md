## 1. Leibniz Universit√§t, Hannover
I'm currently working at **L3S Research Centre, LUH** as a research assistant. My work involves developing representation learning algorithms for reinforcement learning tasks like value function approximation. I'm working with Prof Avishek Anand and Dr. Megha Khosla.

## 2. Goldman Sachs, Bengaluru
Last summer I worked with **Goldman Sachs** in the Securities division. I developed a complete web application for a trading platform. It was developed with **ReactJS**. Another project involved building a **predictive mathematical model** for market impact of large orders. It also involved developing visualization tools to show market trends. 

## 3. Microsoft - IDC, Hyderabad
I worked with **Microsoft India Development Center** in the summer of 2018. I was in the STCI team, specifically **Bing**. There are multiple teams in Bing, and I was a part of the Knowledge Graph team, called **Satori**. I worked with one of India's leading data scientist, **Joy Mustafi**.
My work was on **entity classification** problem. As one can imagine, Bing has a mammoth task of being able to answer queries of so many different kinds. For efficient answering of queries, every entity in the database has to be given a type.In fact, each entity is a part of an ontology. My task was to improve the precision and recall of the this classification. I used **Machine Learning** and **NLP** techniques along with **Neural Nets** to do so. I not only learnt these skills, but it made gave me insight on how these techniques are employed on such a large scale. It was a wonderful experience working with Microsoft for 8 weeks!

## 4. Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun:
**IIRS** is a Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) affiliated institute of remote sensing. I interned at IIRS in the summer of 2017 in the **Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Lab**. My mentors were scientists **Shefali Agarwal and Shashi Kumar**. My work was on calibration of satellites. Specifically, I worked on datasets from a category of satellites called **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** satellites. These satellites periodically send data to Earth. To make sure that the measurements made by the satellite are reliable, they are periodically calibrated. For calibration, they take images of reflectors on Earth whose reflectance properties are known. Then the experimental and theoretical values are compared and we get an idea of how reliable the satellite measurements are.

My task was to develop a tool to calculate the calibration parameters from those satellite images. I applied **image processing** techniques to do so. Along with that, a complete end to end pipeline was made with Python. The software and the code was made publicly available [here](https://github.com/WVik/sar-calibration-using-snappy).
