## 1. Parallelization of Graph Clustering Algorithms
Currently I work in the **Advanced Data Analytics and Parallel Technologies** (ADAPT) **Lab** at BITS Pilani. I'm working under the guidance of [Prof Shan Balasubramaniam](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/sundarb/profile) and [Mr. Saiyedul Islam](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/sislam/profile). My work is on implementing parallel **hierarchical divisive algorithms** for graph clustering. I'm also working on an in-house **domain specific language for parallelizing** clustering algorithms called, **DWARF**. The DWARF compiler analyses the code and generates optimized parallel code in **C++** using **MPI**.

## 2. Breast Cancer Prediction - Data Mining
As a part of the course **Data Mining (CS F415)**, I implemented classification algorithms like **K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine**, and ensemble techniques like **bagging and boosting**. The dataset was taken from UCI Wisconsin. I also did a comparative study on metrics like training time and accuracy. Also inferences based on feature importance was done. The implementation and the review report can be found

## 3. SVD, LRA and Clustering algorithms
I worked with [Prof. Rajiv Kumar](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rkumar/profile) in an independent project on **Graphs and Networks**. The project was on applications of two powerful linear algebra techniques, viz. **Singular Value Decomposition**, and **Low Rank Approximation** and their applications to graph clustering. **Python** scripts for finding out clusters in a graph was also written.

## 4. YouTube Content Filter
This is an **extension for YouTube** which filters out unwanted videos from a user's feed. The titles of all videos on the page are analysed and based on the title text, the video is classified into categories. The user can choose what category of videos to blacklist. The video will be removed from the feed if it belongs to one of the blacklisted categories. This extension is reinforced by YouTube's algorithm for video suggestions. As the user watches less and less videos of a particular category, YouTube eventually won't suggest those videos. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/WVik/youtube-content-filter)

## 5. JavaScript Games
As a part of APOGEE (BITS Pilani's technical festival), I made a couple of multiplayer games in **JavaScript and PHP**. These were two player mathematical strategy games called **"Zombie Math"** and **"Gambling Math"**. The code can be found here:

* [Gambling](https://github.com/WVik/gamblingmath)
